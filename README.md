	~ Trains will travel from station to station
	~ Inside of a station, when the train stops, passengers will alight and enter the
	  carriages of the train.
	~ A passenger will touch in at the station and touch out at the destination station
	~ Each coach of a train can hold up to 40 passengers
	~ Each train is made of a number of coaches

	~ Add a charging system where the passengers can only touch in a station (and access
	  the train) if their account has more than 2 GBP.
